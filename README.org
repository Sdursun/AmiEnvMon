Calls [[https://github.com/themkat/pico-environment-monitor][my homemade Pico environment monitor API]] to fetch information, and shows them in a nice MUI GUI :)

** Goals
I had a few goals with this project:
- Have a way for my Amiga to view temperature and other environment data in a nice way.
- Experiment with MUI for creating nice Amiga GUIs.
- Take testing (mostly unit testing) as far as possible on a real Amiga.
- Use modern CI/CD to test and release using Github Actions.
